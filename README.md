Ascii-based survival game programmed using Java and the Jansi library.

Runs in the Windows CMD. Requires a newer JDK (17+).

There's a guide text file in the zip with more info. It's incomplete ~~and as of 9/25/23 I have no plans on updating it.~~

Update: 12/18/2023 With some free time and getting the code back after a pc reset, I will be updating this.
